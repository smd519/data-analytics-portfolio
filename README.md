## 1. [Category Mining](https://github.com/smd519/data-analytics-portfolio/blob/main/Product_Reviews/CategoryMining.ipynb)
In this project, we analyze a product-reviews dataset from the Amazon Kindle Store(e-books).Our hypothesis is that users interested in a certain type of book (e.g., books about sports) tend to rate and review similar books. We test this hypothesis, by running a spectral co-clustering of a user-product graph to see how books cluster.
+ The clustering code comes from the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/) package. 
+ We prepare the data and process the results.
